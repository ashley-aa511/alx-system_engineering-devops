# Postmortem: Nginx Server Outage

## Issue Summary

- **Duration of Outage**: June 12, 2024, from 14:00 to 15:00 UTC
- **Impact**: Our primary web service experienced significant downtime, with users facing slow response times or complete failure to load the site. Approximately 47% of user requests failed.
- **Root Cause**: The root cause was a misconfigured Nginx server that could not handle the high volume of concurrent connections, leading to a bottleneck and subsequent request failures.

## Timeline

- **14:00**: Issue detected via monitoring alerts indicating a spike in failed HTTP requests.
- **14:05**: Initial investigation began by the on-call engineer; logs were reviewed.
- **14:15**: Nginx configuration files were examined for potential misconfigurations.
- **14:25**: Assumption that the issue was related to server resource limits; increased server memory and CPU resources.
- **14:30**: Misleading path taken by assuming hardware limitations were the root cause; adjusted resource allocations did not resolve the issue.
- **14:40**: Incident escalated to the web infrastructure team.
- **14:45**: Detailed log analysis revealed that the number of worker processes and maximum number of connections were misconfigured.
- **14:50**: Configuration files were updated to increase worker processes and connections.
- **14:55**: Nginx server restarted; performance and error rates monitored.
- **15:00**: Normal operation resumed; no further request failures observed.

## Root Cause and Resolution

- **Root Cause**: The Nginx server was configured with insufficient worker processes and a low maximum number of connections per worker. This misconfiguration led to the server's inability to handle high traffic loads, resulting in a significant number of failed requests during the ApacheBench testing.

- **Resolution**: The Nginx configuration was updated to increase the `worker_processes` to match the number of CPU cores and the `worker_connections` to a higher value (e.g., 1024). Additionally, the `keepalive_timeout` was adjusted to optimize connection handling. After making these changes, the server was restarted, and subsequent tests showed no failed requests.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

- **Improvements/Fixes**:
  - Conduct a thorough review of Nginx configurations to ensure they align with best practices for handling high traffic.
  - Implement more robust monitoring to detect configuration issues before they impact users.
  - Establish better documentation and guidelines for server configuration to avoid similar issues in the future.

- **Tasks**:
  - **Patch Nginx Server**: Apply recommended configurations for high-performance environments.
  - **Add Monitoring on Server Memory and Connections**: Implement tools to monitor and alert on memory usage and connection metrics.
  - **Review and Optimize Configurations**: Regularly audit server configurations to ensure optimal performance.
  - **Load Testing**: Perform regular load testing to identify and address potential bottlenecks.
  - **Training**: Provide training sessions for the engineering team on Nginx configuration and performance tuning.

This postmortem highlights the importance of proper server configuration and the value of detailed monitoring and logging. By addressing these issues, we can improve our system's resilience and ensure a better user experience.
